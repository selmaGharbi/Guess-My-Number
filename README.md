A simple game to guess the number

This was my very first project while learning JavaScript.
The game is funny and the player should guess a number, until it is equal to the secret number.
In each stage, there is information given to the player, if the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number.
There is the option to restart the game, by keeping the highscore value of previous games as well.
